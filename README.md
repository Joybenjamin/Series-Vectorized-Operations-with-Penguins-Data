# Series-Vectorized-Operations-with-Penguins-Data
This is one of my first basic project with numpy and pandas on jupyter notebook.
In this lab, I worked with a dataset that contains information about penguins. Each penguin is described by various attributes such as species, island, culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, body mass, and gender.

This is for my practice of vectorized operations on Pandas series. I learnT how to perform arithmetic operations on series and apply mathematical functions to series.

In addition to individual topic-based activities, there was also  mixed-topic activities that require ME to combine different operations to achieve a specific outcome.
